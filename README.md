Insightful Learning through Dialog-Action-Reflection

# Dojo Sample Model

According to Wikipedia ...

A dōjō (道場, Japanese pronunciation: [doꜜː(d)ʑoː][note 1]) is a hall or place for immersive learning, experiential learning or meditation. This is traditionally in the field of martial arts, but has been seen increasingly in other fields, such as meditation and software development. The term literally means "place of the Way" in Japanese.

Just as a traditional dōjō provides a space for martial arts training, the Dojo Community offers an environment for immersive learning in technology and innovation.

While each Dojo Domain has an ever evolving curriculum online, we also have Dojo Circle meetups where people on the same journey across SAP come together and share.  This really helps deepen the exploration of whatever topic we are focusing on whether in the domain of Mindset, Agile, InnerSource or more technically focused domains such as Observability, Kubernetes or FinOps.

On the Dojo Mat, the engaging dialog helps us find ways to apply what we are learning about back in our home departments and or personal development journeys.

In the words of those of the community:

*The Dojo circle calls are my favorite part of the journey, I love how we listen and grow, opinions change, the growth mindset is embodied.*
